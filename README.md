Description
The objective of this project is to integrate the News API to fetch and display real-time news headlines on a news website. The project demonstrates the ability to work with external APIs, handle data responses, and integrate functionality into a sample news website.

Requirements
Frontend Integration:

Create a new section on the homepage of the news website to display the latest headlines.
Display at least 5 headlines along with the article source and publication date.
Backend Integration (Optional):

If applicable, create a route to fetch news headlines from the News API.
Cache the responses to reduce the number of API calls.
Error Handling:

Display a user-friendly message if there are issues fetching the headlines.
Technical Considerations
Frontend:

Use React as the frontend framework.
Fetch data from the News API using asynchronous requests (e.g., fetch or Axios).
Backend (Optional):
